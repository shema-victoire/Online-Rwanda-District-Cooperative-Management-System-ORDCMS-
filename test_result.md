### API Endpoints Implemented
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/cooperatives` - Create cooperative
- `GET /api/cooperatives` - List cooperatives (with role-based filtering)
- `PUT /api/cooperatives/{id}/approve` - Approve cooperative

### User Roles & Permissions
1. **District Official**: Can approve cooperatives, view all cooperatives in their district, generate reports
2. **Cooperative Leader**: Can create cooperatives, manage members, schedule meetings
3. **Member**: Can view their cooperative info, check savings, see upcoming meetings

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Instructions
Test the following endpoints with proper authentication:
1. User registration with different roles
2. User login and JWT token validation
3. Cooperative creation with proper data validation
4. Cooperative approval workflow (district officials only)
5. Role-based access control for all endpoints

### Frontend Testing Instructions
1. **Authentication Flow**: Registration â†’ Login â†’ Dashboard navigation
2. **Cooperative Management**: Create â†’ View â†’ Filter â†’ Approve (for district officials)
3. **Role-based Navigation**: Verify different menu items for different roles
4. **Responsive Design**: Test on different screen sizes
5. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid inputs and network errors

## Next Development Phases
